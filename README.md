Hello, I am Max (He/Him), a PostDoc in airborne geophysics at the British Antarctic Survey. I am working on gravity and magnetic data processing and inverse modelling using the first large scale airborne gravity and magnetic data measured by an UAV in Antarctica.
I am on a fixed term contract and I am looking for a PostDoc / academic position from September 2024.

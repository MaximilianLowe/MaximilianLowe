Hello friends, I am Max (He/Him), a PostDoc in airborne geophysics at kiel University and I am an "Honorary Researcher" at the British Antarctic Survey. I am mainly working on gravity and magnetic data processing and joint inversion to investigate curstal and lithospheric structues. 

I recently finished a PostDoc at the British Antarctic survey working on aiborne gravity and magnetic data, which was for the first time measured by an large UAV in Antarctica. I did my PhD at the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge and the University of Edinburgh. Read more about my work at: https://www.bas.ac.uk/profile/maxwe32/

Hi, I am Max, PostDoc in airborne geophysics at Kiel University and a British Antarctica Survey Honorary Researcher. I am Co-Chair of the SCAR INSTANT sub-committee Antarctic Geological Boundary Conditions (ABC). 
My main research interests are 3D lithospheric modeling with satellite and airborne gravity & magnetic data, Solid Earth – Cryosphere interactions, heat flow in polar regions, tectonophysics, and probabilistic modeling and inversion.

Previous affiliations: British Antarctic Survey (Cambridge), University of Edinburgh, SENSE – Center for Satellite Data in Environmental Science.
